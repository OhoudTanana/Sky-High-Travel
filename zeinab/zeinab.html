<b><p style="font-size:40px; text-align:center"> Most Popular Foods You Have To Eat In Japan</p>

<img id="image" src="japan2.jpg" alt="japan2" height="50%" width="100%">


<p style="font-size:25px; margin-left:20px; margin-right:20px"><i>As many of you already know, Japan is famous for its wonderful and unique cuisine. But when we think about Japanese food, the first thing that comes to mind is fish and rice. This blog post will give you a wider view about the food culture in Japan, and teach you what to order from the moment you sit at the restaurant.</p></i>

 <div class="imageborder">
 <b style="font-size:20px">1.Suchi and Sashimi</b><br>
 <div class="tc-container">
 <image src="sushi1.jpg" alt="sushi1" width="50%" height="50%" align="left" onmouseover="image6(this);" onmouseout="imageout6(this);" >
 <br><br><br>
 <p style="font-size:20px"> Sushi is known all over the world and is unique in its creation because every piece of rice is seasoned with a rice vinegar mix (made with sugar and salt) and then mixed with different ingredients such as a variety of seafood, vegetables, and nori (seaweed). You can just grab a piece of sushi with chopsticks and dip it into soy sauce or wasabi, or both. It is truly a mix of flavors in your mouth! Depending on the shape and ingredients that are used, sushi can be called different names: Nigiri sushi, Maki sushi, Oshi sushi, Temaki sushi, etc.

Sashimi is basically raw fish or seafood served with wasabi (a spicy Japanese condiment) and soy sauce. It generally comes with slices of radish on the side. The name sashimi comes from a tradition of presenting the fish itself with the meal to identify which kind of fish you are eating.

 <br><br><br>
 <p class="font">Tempura is a Japanese fried dish made mostly from seafood and vegetables. It is seasoned with a sauce made with soy sauce, ginger and sugar. Tempura can be made using almost any and every vegetable. The size of the piece has to be able to be eaten in one bite and despite being deep fried, Tempura does not have an oily texture. Tempura is usually served with Tetsuyu sauce that is a mix of consommé, sweet sake, soy sauce, ginger, radish and spices.

<br><br><br>
<p class="font">Also a very popular, simple and delicious dish that we can find in Japan, Kare-Raisu is just rice with curry but the taste is certainly different from any other curry dishes. To make Japanese curry, you can use a variety of meats and vegetables. The basic vegetables are onions, carrots and sweet potatoes, and the meats used are chicken, pork, beef and sometimes duck.

<br><br><br>
<p class="font">
Escargot, or cooked snails, are a beloved French delicacy that is usually served as an appetizer. Before preparation, the snails must be purged, removed from their shells, and cooked, usually with garlic butter, chicken stock, or wine. Their tender texture and clean, woody flavors pair especially nicely with herb-infused butter - garlic, thyme, and parsley are the most common choices.

<br><br><br>
<p class="font">The fondant au Chocolat is one of the best-known French desserts. It is a chocolate cake cooked in a way that the heart of the cake is still warm and liquid.

It pairs very well with vanilla English cream custard. Its softness makes it an extremely pleasant dessert to eat as well as its taste that will make you want more!

<br><br><br>
<p class="font">This dish is called, in English, “Salmon in Parchment.” It is perhaps one of the most unique ways to cook a fish. Essentially, you wrap the salmon and vegetables inside a piece of parchment, and you let them all cook together. 
What happens is that each individual flavor—juices and all—blend together to form a delicious meal. This is a very famous French food that you should definitely consider trying if you travel to France. Additionally, even if you don’t plan to travel to France anytime soon, this dish would make an excellent option for when you have friends and family over for dinner.

<b><p style="font-size:40px; text-align:center">Best Local Foods You Must Eat In Singapore </p>
<img class ="image1" src="singapore1.jpg" width="80%" height="60%" >

<p style="font-size:25px;font-weight:bold">Singapore is a foodie's paradise. Singapore cuisine is an exciting blend of many influences. Here are essential Singaporean dishes to try.</i></p>

<div class="imageborder">
<b class="font">1. Chicken Rice</b><br>
<div class="tc-container">
<img src="chicken1.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" align="left" onmouseover="image16(this);" onmouseout="imageout16(this);" >
<br><br><br>
<p class="font">Over the years, with a few uniquely Singaporean tweaks, what we have today is succulent steamed white chicken served on the most aromatic rice that is cooked in chicken broth. Oh, and you have to eat it with the signature garlic-chilli dip because chicken rice is not complete without it.

 

Nowadays, there are variations of Hainanese chicken rice that you can choose from - steamed, roasted or braised in soya sauce. Most stalls also offer side dishes such as blanched vegetables, chicken innards and braised eggs. 
</p>
</div>
</div>




<div class="imageborder">
<b class="font">2. Nasi Lemak</b><br>
<div class="tc-container">
<img src="nasi1.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" align="left" onmouseover="nasi17(this);" onmouseout="nasiout17(this);">
<br><br><br>
<p class="font">The highlight of this famous Singapore hawker food is the aromatic rice that is cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaves. Fragrant and fluffy, a sniff of the Nasi Lemak rice is enough to whet your appetite. Another important part that completes this dish is the homemade sambal – a chilli paste made from blending chilies, belacan (shrimp paste), garlic and other spices.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="imageborder">
<b class="font">3. Laksa</b><br>
<div class="tc-container">
<img src="laksa1.jpg" height="50%" width="50%" align="left" onmouseover="laksa18(this);" onmouseout="laksaout18(this);" >
<br><br><br>
<p class="font"> Another classic famous Singapore food is Laksa, an exquisite spicy noodle soup dish that is loved by all races here. Thick rice noodles with slices of fishcake, prawns, beansprouts and cockles are served in a rich soup made from curry, coconut milk and spices.


Savoury, creamy and fragrant, Laksa is a dish with an explosion of flavours that will leave you lingering for more!

<div class="imageborder">
<b class="font">4. Fried Carrot Cake</b></br>
<div class="tc-container">
<img src="f1.jpg" height="50%" width="50%" align="left" onmouseover="f119(this);" onmouseout="f1out19(this);" >
<br><br><br>
<p class="font">Fried Carrot Cake is well-loved and famous local hawker dish with two variations - black and white. The black one is fried with dark soya sauce which gives it a slight smoky sweetness, while the white one is fried only with eggs that result in a crispier crust. That being said, both versions are lip-smackingly good and each have its own fans. 
</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class="imageborder">
<b class="font">5. Kambing Soup</b><br>
<div class="tc-container">
<img src="kamb1.jpg" height="50%" width="50%" align="left"onmouseover="kamb20(this);" onmouseout="kambout20(this);" >
<br><br><br>
<p class="font">This remarkable dish is made by cooking various parts of the lamb in a rich broth of spices such as coriander, fennel, cumin, star anise and cinnamon. After brewing it lovingly for hours, the meat becomes so tender that it falls off the bone. The soup is intensely satisfying with a strong meaty flavour that is enhanced by the spices and herbs used.

<p style="font-size:40px; font-weight:bold; text-align:center"> Best Foods In Lebanon</p>
<img class="image1" src="lebanon.jpg" width="80%" height="60%" >

<p style="font-size:25px;font-weight:bold"><i>Lebanese food opens your palette to a world of fascinating flavors that get better with every bite. Here are some traditional Lebanese foods you simply need to try.</i></p>

<div class="imageborder">
<b class="font">1. Falafel</b></br>
<div class="tc-container">
<img src="falafel2.jpg" align="left" width="50%" height="50%" onmouseover="falafel21(this);" onmouseout="falafelout21(this);">
<br><br><br>
<p class="font">Falafel is one of the most popular Lebanese dishes globally for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike, offering a savory snack or meal.

Falafel has a perfectly crunchy outer layer that cedes to a soft, fluffy inside, bestowing an irresistible texture profile. 

You’ll find falafel on the appetizer menu at any Lebanese eatery. You can also use it as a salad topper or, my personal favorite, wrapped in a pita with hummus or Labneh and pickled vegetables. 
</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class="imageborder">
<b class="font">2.Kibbeh</b></br>
<div class="tc-container">
<img src="kibbeh1.jpg" height="50%" width="50%" align="left"onmouseover="kibbeh22(this);" onmouseout="kibbehout22(this);" >
<br><br><br>
<p class="font">The national dish of Lebanon, Kibbeh, is a croquette made by mashing bulgur wheat and minced meat into a thick paste, adding pine nuts and spices, then forming oblong balls and deep-frying them.
</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class="imageborder">
<b class="font">3.Shawarma</b></br>
<div class="tc-container">
<img src="shawarma1.jpg" align="left" height="50%" width="50%"onmouseover="shawarma23(this);" onmouseout="shawarmaout23(this);" >
<br><br><br>
<p class="font">You’ll often see shawarma being roasted on the spit in the window or open kitchen of a Lebanese restaurant or street cart.

Shawarma was originally made with goat or mutton meat, but you can also find it made with beef, chicken, turkey, or veal. 

Lebanese chefs will slice thin pieces of meat directly from the spit to enjoy as a platter with rice, dips, and vegetables or wrapped in thin pita bread as a sandwich.

I’m partial to the shawarma pita, which comes with tasty sauces, pickled vegetables, and fresh veggies.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="imageborder">
<b class="font">4.Fattoush</b></br>
<div class="tc-container">
<img src="fatoush1.jpg" height="50%" width="50%" align="left" onmouseover="fattoush24(this);" onmouseout="fattoushout24(this);">
<br><br><br>
<p class="font">It’s a simple salad of mixed greens and stale pieces of pita or flatbread baked to a crouton crisp.

You can add tomato, onions, radish, or any other vegetable you like. 

It’s usually dressed with olive oil, dried herbs, and lemon juice. Some recipes add Sumac or pomegranate molasses for an extra tang. 

Fattoush is a delicious and easily prepared side dish to accompany any meat dish, pita wrap, or mezze meal. I love the crunchy flatbread pieces that soak up the dressing.

<div class="imageborder">

<div class="tc-container">
<img src="mutabal1.jpg" height="50%" width="50%" align="left"onmouseover="mutabal25(this);" onmouseout="mutabalout25(this);"  >
<br><br><br>
<p class="font">Mutabal is another term for Baba Ghanoush, a famous eggplant dip made with roasted and mashed eggplant, tahini, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper.
Perhaps the most ubiquitous Lebanese dish on the planet, hummus is a beloved bean dip made with garbanzo beans, tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, and paprika.
